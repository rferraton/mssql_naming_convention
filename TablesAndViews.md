## Tables and Views naming conventions :

### TV1 : No prefix for object type
T_ or V_ are not allowed for object type designation. reporting tools sometimes use tables and sometimes use views (sometimes both), it is usefull to be able to switch from a table to a view. An object type prefix would dissallow this kind of switch.

### TV2 : Tables and Views prefixes :
