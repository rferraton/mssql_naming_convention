| Object Type       |	Prefix     |	Description |
| :---              | :----:     | ---:        |
| Tables and Views  |	F          |	Fact tables or views|
| Tables and Views  |	D          |	Dimension / referential tables or views |
| Tables and Views  |	A          |	Anomalies or Rejects tables or views |
| Tables and Views  |	L          |	Links tables or views |
| Tables and Views  |	T          |	Transformation tables (YTD,12RMâ€¦) or views |
| Tables and Views  |	S          |	Subscriptions tables or views |
| Tables and Views  |	Z          |	Temp or work tables |
| Tables and Views  |	P          |	Parameters tables or views |
| Tables and Views  |	M          |	Metadata tables or views |
| Tables and Views  |	N          |	Logging, Notifications, Traces tables or views |

NB : T_ or V_ are not allowed for object type (Table or View) designation. reporting tools sometimes use tables and sometimes use views (sometimes both), it is usefull to be able to switch from a table to a view. An object type prefix would dissallow this kind of switch.
